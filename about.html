<h1>About Me - Davante Starling</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Davante, and I am a new and passionate web developer with a strong foundation in both technology
and health sciences. I hold a master’s degree in Information Systems and a bachelor’s in Exercise Physiology. My
technical experience includes working with Visual Studio, PgAdmin, SQL Server, Python, and Excel—tools I enjoy using
to solve real-world problems and create efficient, user-friendly applications.</p>

<p>Beyond my career, I’m a devoted husband to my wonderful wife, Erin, and a proud father to our amazing son, Rex, I
love spending time outdoors-fishing, hunting, and especially being around trucks. These hobbies keep me grounded and
connected to nature.</p>

<p>Most importantly, my faith in my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ defines who I am. Hebrews 11:6 reminds me of the
importance of faith, and my family and I live by the powerful encouragement in Hebrew 10:19-25. My goal is to grow not
only as a developer but also as a servant of Christ, bringing integrity, purpose, and joy to everything I do. Thank you
for taking the time to get to know a little about me!</p>
